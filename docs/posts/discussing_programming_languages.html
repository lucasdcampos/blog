            <h1>Discussing Programming Languages</h1><p>"There are two types of programming languages, does everyone complain about, and the ones no one use"</p>
<p>I guess this is true in a way, so I kind of decided to build my own (and it was a crazy idea). It all started in
2023, when I was curious about how programming languages worked, It seemed like magic at that time.</p>
<p>So I developed a small interpreted language called SPL (Simple Programming Language, lol). It was like 1am when
I started the project, and I finished it about 2 hours later because I realised it was already 3am and I needed to sleep.</p>
<p>I must say I learned a thing or two about interpreters and how languages were made, but I implemented it reading the source code
character by character, without even using a Lexer/Tokenizer, it was a mess.</p>
<p><code>print "Hello, World!";</code><br>
<code>set x 10;</code><br>
<code>set y 20;</code><br>
<code>print sum x y; // 10+20</code><br></p>
<p>Yeah, not that impressive...</p>
<p>So almost a year later, in University this time, I had a presentation to make, we could choose the topics we're gonna present.
I decided to talk about how programming languages worked under the hood, but I wouldn't stop there, I wanted to create a new 
programming language and showcase it at the presentation.</p>
<p>The idea was to create a programming language with It's syntax entirely in portuguese, basically a portuguese version of Lua (which was also
made by brazilians). The language would be used to teach programming to portuguese speakers in a easier way, instead of conventional languages in english
and full of symbols like semicolons and braces.</p>
<p><code>funcao soma(a, b)</code><br>
<code>retornar a+b</code><br>
<code>fim</code><br>
<code>exibir(soma(1,2))</code><br></p>
<p>This basically creates a function that returns the sum of two numbers, cool.</p>
<p>Well, I won't talk much about it, because the language It's in portuguese, but It's getting pretty advanced tho, it has
classes, methods, functions, variables and constants, and even a standard library.</p>
<p>But I'm planning on developing other languages, I have an idea for a Stack Based Virtual Machine, the portuguese one is a Tree-Walker Interpreter, so It's not
very fast.</p>
<p>I learned a lot by implementing these languages, now I'm reading the Crafting Interpreters book, It is a incredible resource to learn.</p>
