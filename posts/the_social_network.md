# About The Social Network

Recently I watched The Social Network, it was a college's homework, but the funny thing is that I was already planning to watch it anyway, so whatever.

I must say that it was an amazing movie, and I'll definitely rewatch it, because there are a lot of little details that you don't get on your first watch.
I liked it because there isn't 
a lot of movies that shows programming in a realistic way, even though this movie itself isn't focused on programming.

Probably my favorite scene is the one Mark starts building facemash.com, it was just perfect, Mark's narration, the soundtrack, ambience, all combined
together. He points out how easy it was to hack some of Harvard's Houses, but also comment about the dificult ones. It wasn't just a "Press Random Keys to Hack Nasa" scene,
he used real tools and terms, like some scenes of Mr. Robot.

Also, I liked the fact that Mark has his own personal blog, and I remembered I should also start posting here more often. Of course I'm not going to offend people online 
(probably).

I'm starting my second year at college, and I don't have any great project yet. Well, I have **Libra**, my programming language, it has a few stars on GitHub, but that's not enough.
I'll try to think at something, no need to be a bilionaire idea, just a project people can use, but this may be difficult.

Well, back at the movie, a lot of it's events aren't real, I understand thats for make the story more interesting, but I don't know, I would prefer the real story. I also
discovered that the movie is based on a book called "The Accidental Bilionaires", and I'll definitely read it at some point, I guess this one is closer to the reality.
