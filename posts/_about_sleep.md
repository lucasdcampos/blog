# About Sleep

9:52 PM, and I have a new crazy idea.

I was reading _0atman's_ blog and I discovered something new: Everyman 2, or E2 for short.

I still don't know exactly what this is, but it consists in having a core sleep and two naps across the day, the thing is, I
work better at night (around 2 ~ 3 AM), but It's impossible for my body to sleep at 3pm and wake up at 6am, that's simply not possible.

The way E2 works is, I can sleep early (11pm) and wake up at 4:30 for example, this would result in 5.5 hours of sleep, not enough, but
I could later on take some naps to help me _not die_.

Original's E2 is even more harsh, I think it only allows 3 hours of sleep or something like that, no way I would do this.

Well, I'm planning on experimenting that for a week and see how it goes, I'm gonna sleep in a few minutes and tomorrow I'll relate my
experience. Good night.
