Hi, this is my first post on my blog, I would say that this is just a test post, so I hope everything is working correctly.

I'm trying to use a python script to generate the final html and css files based on my **Obsidian** markdown files. I know there are programs that already do that, but I don't want to learn them, and I wan't to make my own.

I'll try to post alt least once a week, but I don't promise anything, probably I'll just post whenever I feel like it.

Well, I guess thats it for this post, I didn't have anything useful to say anyways. See ya!
