## Info
My name is Lucas Maciel de Campos, I'm a brazilian software developer and computer science enthusiast who likes complex and low-level areas such as compilers, chess engines, game engines, and more.

I started graduating in Sao Paulo College of Technology in 2024, but my contact with programming started early on in 2015, when my father teached me the basics of programming and my first language, Visual Basic.

Later on I decided to learn C# and make games using the Unity Game Engine, until I started to study how game engines worked under the hood, and then make my own.

Today I'm interested in areas that are more low level, I began to study how compilers and programming languages worked, chess engines, AI, etc.
