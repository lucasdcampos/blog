## ðŸ‘‹ Hi. I'm Lucas Campos

Hello! I'm a Brazilian software developer and a curious person.

I created this website to serve as my "home base" on the internet, sometimes I post
some interesting things here or just share my projects.

I don't post much on my blog, but sometimes it's nice to see old posts.
