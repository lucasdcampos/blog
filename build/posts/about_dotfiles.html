        <h1>About dotfiles</h1>
<p>Well, a thing that always irritates me when I'm setting up a new machine or formatting my main one is configuring everything once again.</p>
<p>I don't want to type a hundred commands just to set up my development environment, so I've been working on a custom script that will
automate that process for me. I think everyone is familiar with the concept of <em>dotfiles</em>, hidden files in Unix based Operating Systems that
serves mainly to be configuration files for specific programs.</p>
<p>I have a few computers and I often alter between then, even on my main PC I have different Virtual Machines and sometimes I also SSH into a Linux Server, 
so I want everything to be easy to transfer and compatible with all kinds of systems.</p>
<h2>My dotfiles repo</h2>
<p>First I created a <strong>GitHub Repo</strong> to store my dotfiles, that was a start, sure, but then I ran into some issues. For me to use my configs I had to 
manually clone the repo, copy the files one by one and type some commands to install and configure dependencies. Also, another problem appeared: The
files in the dotfiles repo itself aren't the real files, so I needed some way to sync the repo files to the actual config files at my home directory.</p>
<p>Repo files: <code>~/.dotfiles/.config/</code></p>
<p>Real files: <code>~/.config/</code></p>
<p>I then created a simple <strong>Python Script</strong> to manage all my configuration files, it would just copy everything from the repo's directory to my home directory,
easy peasy. I also added a script to pull changes from GitHub and sync them locally.</p>

<h2>Instalation Script</h2>
<p>In order to install and use my dotfiles, you just need to run this simple Shell Script:</p>
<p><code>git clone https://github.com/lucasdcampos/dotfiles .dotfiles &amp;&amp; chmod +x .dotfiles/scripts/setup.sh &amp;&amp; ./.dotfiles/scripts/setup.sh</code></p>
<p>You can reload the configuration files by typing <code>.r</code> at your terminal, and sync with github with the <code>.s</code> command, everything convenient.</p>
<h2>About Vim</h2>
<p>I also started using Vim (NeoVim) more, I never took time before to actually stop and configure Vim, I was scared of configuring it, but it was actually really simple!
With a plugin manager is very easy to install plugins and customize the editor.</p>
<p>Of course I'm still very unproductive with it, it's hard to get yourself used to the keybindings, but that's just a matter of time.</p>
